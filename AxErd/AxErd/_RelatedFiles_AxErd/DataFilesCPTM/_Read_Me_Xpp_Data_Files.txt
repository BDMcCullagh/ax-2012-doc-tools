These data files have been manually improved by replacement of their OWNER names to their official APP MODULES names.

In retrospect, those manual updates were unwise.
Instead, should now use CModuleFileOwnerInfo to cross-reference from internal X++ Excel Owner, to module (or pseudo-module where not in AX6 UI).
